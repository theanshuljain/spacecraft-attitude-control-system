# Spacecraft Attitude Control System

## Overview
This project involves the design and analysis of a spacecraft attitude control system. Frequency-response data from a mockup plant were used to derive system models and design controllers to meet specified phase and gain margins.

## Key Objectives
- Develop transfer function and state-space models of spacecraft rotational dynamics.
- Design compensators using pole placement and LQR control principles.
- Analyze system stability using Bode, Nyquist, and Root Locus methods.
- Simulate closed-loop response under various input profiles and actuator limits.

## Tools and Methods
- MATLAB, Simulink
- Frequency-domain and time-domain analysis
- State-space and feedback control design
- Eigenvalue and damping analysis

## Results
- Achieved stability margins and dynamic performance per design specifications.
- Validated through closed-loop simulations and step/sinusoidal response tests.
